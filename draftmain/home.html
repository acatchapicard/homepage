		<h1> Welcome Page</h1>
		<p> Dear visitor,<br> <br>

			Welcome! My name is Angelique Catcha-Picard.and I am originally
from Abidjan, the economical capital of Ivory Coast. However,I have spent the last four years
of my life in Melbourne, Florida. where I am currently a senior majoring in mechanical 
engineering at Florida Institute of Technology. To find out more about me, click here. <br> <br>

My main idea when designing this website was to build a space for me to share my 
passion for engineering and sciences. Hence,the Blog will be filled with articles on 
topics including but not limited to renewable energies, energy harvesting, and 
sustainability. <br> <br>
In the Tutoring and Tutorials section, I will attempt to use the experience gathered 
while working as a peer tutor to create notes on most of the classes I took during my
bachelor. I truly hope that this will help whoever needs it!
Finally, you have guessed it, My Projects will be dedicated to the projects I have been working on.
There, I will go over the science,thought process and logistic involved in each of my personal project,
be it big or small. <br> <br>
 
Of course,please rember that this website is a work in progress. Both the content and the design of it are 
set to evolve quite a bit in the future. Anyway, I hope you will enjoy exploring these pages 
as much as I enjoy creating them! <br> <br>

Oh and before I forget, if you have any feedbacks or questions about my content, or you 
would simply like to say hi, you can reach out to me by clicking here.<br><br> 

Cheers, <br><br>

A. Catcha-Picard
